-- | Haskell is a Strong type language and it encourage of the use of types all the time.
--  It make it really simple create new types alias just using the operator [type] or product types (algebras) using [data]

-- |Data type
--  ---------

-- | We specify to Haskell a new data type Fruit, which can only be a type Apple, Banana, Pineapple and Orange
data Fruit = Apple
          | Banana
          | Pineapple
          | Orange
          | Coconut
          | Strawberry

-- | We define a function which receive a Fruit type and return the description of the ingredients
menuFunc :: Fruit -> String
menuFunc fruit =  case fruit of
                       Apple   -> "Sweet, red and hard"
                       Banana  -> "Sweet, yellow and soft"
                       Pineapple   -> "Bitter, yellow and soft"
                       Orange      -> "Bitter, orange and soft"
                       Coconut      -> "Sweet, brown and hard"
                       Strawberry      -> "Bitter, red and soft"

type Smoothie = [Fruit]

outputMenu =  map menuFunc tropicalSmoothie

-- | Product Type
--   ------------
-- | Types defined form haskell types
type Name = String
type Surname = String
type Age = Int

-- | Algebras defined as sum type and product type
--  Sum types are those types like enum where use polymorphism and only can have one specific type. In This case
--  Male or Female.
--  Also the operator deriving (Show) it will allow make the algebra being extendable from print
data Sex = Male | Female deriving (Show) -- Data type or Sum type

-- | Product types are a different
-- | We also have to define as first argument the Person again, as value constructor name.
