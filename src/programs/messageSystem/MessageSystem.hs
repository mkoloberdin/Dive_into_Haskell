  Init function to configure the socket following the next steps:
   * Create a new channel for the communications.
   * Bind the socket to listen in the port configured.
   * Invoke [newChan] function to sets up the read and write end of a channel by initialising [Chan] with
     empty @MVar@s for read and empty @MVar@ for write
     Thanks to haskell infer types, [newChan] know that [Chan a] is the same than the one we return in the function
