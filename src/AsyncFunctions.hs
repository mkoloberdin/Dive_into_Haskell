-- | Async operator
-- ---------------------
{-| With async operator we ensure the operation is executed in another thread.
    Here we wait and block for the resolution of the execution until we get the result from the other thread.
    We can also of course compose multiple results as we can see in the second code base. |-}

                        print ( map toUpper response1, response2)

{-| Another example here we use also async operators, passing two monads to a function that expect to
    receive this two monad strings and then we use the async and wait for the results.-}

-- | Race operator
-- -----------------------
{-| [Race] operator is just like the ScalaZ race operator, is running two operations in multiple threads, and the first one
    that finish win and the other operation is cancelled.
    as a result we receive an [Either] of the two possible types defined in the operations. |-}

-- | ForkIO operator
-- -----------------------
{-| [forkIO] operator is used to run a do block in another thread.
    Here we use an empty MVar, we run a new thread with fork and we listen to the MVar for a new value.
    Then from the main thread we put a value into the variable and since is subscribed from the other thread,
    we're able to print the value in the fork thread. |-}
