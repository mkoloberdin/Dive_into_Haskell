{-|  COMMANDS  -}
{-| ------------}
{-| In Event sourcing pattern [Commands] are the responsible to apply an action that lead into the creation of Events.
    Those events are the agents that can allow us to rehydrate an entity into a particular state in the future.-}

{-| Command function apply the command and create event [BasketCreated] to be rehydrate later on-}

{-| Command function apply the command and create event [ProductAdded] to be rehydrate later on-}

{-| Command function apply the command and create event [ProductRemoved] to be rehydrate later on-}

{-|  EVENTS    -}
{-| ------------}
{-| In Event sourcing pattern [Events] are the events/actions that after apply into an entity, it set in a particular state-}

{-| Declarative function for all Events implementations-}
applyEvent :: Basket -> Event -> Basket

{-| Pure function to create an empty basket-}

{-| Pure function to create a new Basket adding a product in basket-}
applyEvent basket (ProductAdded product price)= Basket (products basket ++ [product]) (increaseAmount basket price) (totalDiscount basket)

{-| Pure function to create a new Basket adding a discount in basket-}
applyEvent basket (DiscountAdded newDiscount) = Basket (products basket)  (reduceAmount basket newDiscount) (increaseAmount basket newDiscount)

{-| Pure function to create a new Basket removing the product and price from previous basket-}
applyEvent basket (ProductRemoved product price) = Basket (removeProductFromBasket product (products basket)) (reduceAmount basket price) (totalDiscount basket)


{-|  PERSISTENCE/REHYDRATE -}

   This function It could be whatever backend (cassandra, couchbase, mongodb) we want to use to persist -}
appendEvent :: [Event] -> Event -> IO [Event]

{-| Fold Function to receive the array of events and recursively apply the function [applyEvent] over the basket
    depending the type of Event is passed.-}
