{-| We embrace type system and Type class pattern that's why we type all primitive types of our system-}

  } deriving (Show, Eq)

newtype Price = Price
  { priceVal :: Double
  } deriving (Show, Eq)

{-| To define this example we will use the typical grocery basket to be rehydrate -}
data Basket = Basket
  { products :: [Product]
  , totalPrice :: Price
  , totalDiscount :: Discount
  } deriving (Show, Eq)

{-| Data type to define all possible events-}

{-|  COMMANDS  -}
{-| ------------}
{-| In Event sourcing pattern [Commands] are the responsible to apply an action that lead into the creation of Events.
    Those events are the agents that can allow us to rehydrate an entity into a particular state in the future.-}
{-| Command function apply the command and create event [BasketCreated] to be rehydrate later on-}
createBasketCommand :: IO Event
createBasketCommand = return $ BasketCreated $ Basket [] (Price 0) (Discount 0)

{-| Command function apply the command and create event [ProductAdded] to be rehydrate later on-}
addProductCommand :: Basket -> Product -> Price -> IO Event
addProductCommand basket product price = return $ ProductAdded product price

{-| Command function apply the command and create event [ProductRemoved] to be rehydrate later on-}
removeProductCommand :: Basket -> Product -> Price -> IO Event
removeProductCommand basket product price = return $ ProductRemoved product price

{-| Command function apply the command and create event [DiscountAdded] to be rehydrate later on-}
addDiscountCommand :: Basket -> Discount -> IO Event
addDiscountCommand basket discount = return $ DiscountAdded discount

{-|  EVENTS    -}
{-| ------------}
{-| In Event sourcing pattern [Events] are the events/actions that after apply into an entity, it set in a particular state-}
{-| Declarative function for all Events implementations-}
applyEvent :: Basket -> Event -> Basket
{-| Pure function to create an empty basket-}
applyEvent basket (BasketCreated _basket) = basket
{-| Pure function to create a new Basket adding a product in basket-}
applyEvent basket (ProductAdded product price) =
  Basket (products basket ++ [product]) (increaseAmount basket price) (totalDiscount basket)
{-| Pure function to create a new Basket adding a discount in basket-}
applyEvent basket (DiscountAdded discount) =
  Basket (products basket) (reduceAmount basket discount) (increaseAmount basket discount)
{-| Pure function to create a new Basket removing the product and price from previous basket-}
applyEvent basket (ProductRemoved product price) =
  Basket (removeProductFromBasket product (products basket)) (reduceAmount basket price) (totalDiscount basket)

{-|  PERSISTENCE/REHYDRATE -}
{-| ------------------------}
{-| Function that return a new [Event] appending the new event.
   This function It could be whatever backend (cassandra, couchbase, mongodb) we want to use to persist -}
appendEvent :: [Event] -> Event -> IO [Event]
appendEvent events event = return $ events ++ [event]

{-| Fold Function to receive the array of events and recursively apply the function [applyEvent] over the basket
    depending the type of Event is passed.-}
rehydrateByEvents :: Basket -> [Event] -> Basket
rehydrateByEvents basket (event:events) = rehydrateByEvents (applyEvent basket event) events
rehydrateByEvents basket [] = basket

--rehydrateByEvents basket events = foldl applyEvent basket events --> Using foldl we can reach same result

{-| Utils  -}
{-| --------}
{-| Function to filter from the list of products the one we want to remove.
    Thanks to eta reduce we dont have to specify the list of products after the filter o the input value of the lamda.-}
removeProductFromBasket :: Product -> [Product] -> [Product]
removeProductFromBasket product = filter (/= product)

{-| Type class pattern implementation to define two implementation with same signature for Price/Discount reducing a lot of boilerplate-}

  reduceAmount :: basket -> moneyToReduce -> newMoney

  reduceAmount basket price = Price $ priceVal (totalPrice basket) - priceVal price
