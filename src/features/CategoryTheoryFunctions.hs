-- | IO Type Monads
-- -----------------
{-| In Haskell we can say that all code section process in a pipeline with [do] it could be monad IO of type X
  We can combine monads between each other as you can see in the example bellow.
  The main monad of your program is the main IO () monad which is the runner of your program.
  You have to think that in Haskell Monads are computational context of a particular type, that when it executed
  it will generate the value type that you specify with your monad.

  The Do block in haskell is the original of how Scala works with sugar for comprehension to flat monads in a pipeline.
  Here we have a IO () monad which it will combine, in this for comprehension type structure of 3 other monads.
  Instead of have to flatMap everyone, the response it will be propagate in the pipeline to be used in the print
  where before we apply a function to make every word upper case |-}
composeMonads :: IO ()
composeMonads = do
                response1 <- getOperation
                response2 <- getOperation1
                response3 <- getOperation2
                print (map toUpper response1 ++ " " ++ map toUpper response2 ++ " " ++ map toUpper response3)

{-| We can pass argument to [do blocks] using function with let as the definition of the variables out of the do block.
    Here as you can see we flatMap two monads and we pass the values to a third function which expect two elements.  -}
sumCompositionMonads :: IO ()
sumCompositionMonads = do
                response1 <- getNumber
                response2 <- getNumber1

                       in do return (number1 + number2) --No sugar the [do] operator it could be removed

{-| Here we apply the same example but instead pass to the third monad the result of the previous monads we pass
    the monads, and we flatMap the values from the monads to finally multiply the values -}

-- | Functor
-- --------------
{-| [Functor] in haskell implement [fmap] operator which is like map for Scala functor types, unwrap the functor and apply a function
    over the type.
    Here we create a Just String with hello and we apply fmap two times and we concat two words in the sentence.-}

    in the same type of context to all elements in the context -}

-- | Monad
-- --------------
{-| In Haskell all the monad types as Maybe provide the [>>=] operator which is the flatMap that you can find in Scala -}

    a function over the monad -}
