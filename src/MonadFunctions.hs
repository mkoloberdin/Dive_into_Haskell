{-| In Haskell we can say that all code section process in a pipeline with [do] it could be monad IO of type X
  We can combine monads between each other as you can see in the example bellow.
  The main monad of your program is the main IO () monad which is the runner of your program.
  You have to think that in Haskell Monads are computational context of a particular type, that when it executed
  it will generate the value type that you specify with your monad.
  This is what is commonly called in Haskell world, pass from pure to impure world.

  The Do block in haskell is the original of how Scala works with sugar for comprehension to flat monads in a pipeline.
  Here we have a IO () monad which it will combine, in this for comprehension type structure of 3 other monads.
  Instead of have to flatMap everyone, the response it will be propagate in the pipeline to be used in the print
  where before we apply a function to make every word upper case |-}
